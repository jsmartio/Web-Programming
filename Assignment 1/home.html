                <h3>What It Means to be a Computer Science Major</h3>
                  <p>Computer science is a discipline that involves the understanding and design of computers and computational processes. Particular interest is placed on making processes efficient and endowing them with some form of intelligence. The discipline ranges from theoretical studies of algorithms to practical problems of implementation in terms of computational hardware and software....In computer science there is an inherent intermingling of the theoretical concepts of computability and algorithmic efficiency with the modern practical advancements in electronics that continue to stimulate advances in the discipline. It is this close interaction of the theoretical and design aspects of the field that binds them together into a single discipline. </p>

                <h3>Computer Science at Stonehill College</h3>
                  <p><i>Rugg's Recommendation on the Colleges places Stonehill's computer science major in a select group of fewer than 100 "very selective" high-quality computer science programs nationwide.</i></p>
                  <p>Here, we have two definitions of computer science: one somewhat technical, the other quite simple. Nonetheless, both emphasize theoretical foundations coupled with hardware and software design.  The curriculum at Stonehill reflects this blend of theory and practice. At Stonehill, computer science courses fall roughly into three overlapping categories: computer theory, computer architecture (hardware), and computer software.</p>
                  <p>Courses in computer <b>theory</b> provide the foundation for tomorrow's technology.  Under the rubric of theory, students study theoretical topics like " computability," "finite state machines," and "graph theory"  as well as the design and analysis of algorithms.</p>
                  <p>The <b>architecture</b> sequence consists of several courses which explore the computer "under the hood."  In one such course, students design their own small computers using a bit of mathematical theory.  Architecture courses allow students to understand computer  hardware from both the engineer's and the programmer's point of view.</p>
                  <p>The <b>software</b> component of the curriculum  begins with elementary computer  programming and progresses to more advanced topics like database management systems, artificial intelligence, and operating systems.  In the final capstone course, seniors, working in  teams, develop large software systems using the principles of  software engineering. </p>
                  <p>Through problem solving and lab work, computer science majors develop an understanding of each of these subject areas as well as the strong relationships among them.  This balanced mix of theory and application, provides graduates with the requisite background for both entry into the computer profession and further graduate study in computer science.</p>

                          <p>Students from the Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown are more independent thanks to a new fully accessible time tracking system designed and implemented by Stonehill students. Last semester, seven computer science majors along with two interdisciplinary studies majors concentrating in technology, worked on the project as part of their Senior Capstone. From coding the program to writing a 220 page user manual, the students developed every aspect of the project which allows Perkins’ students to record their work and volunteer hours electronically. Over the summer, Matt Plummer ’15 worked closely with Perkins on implementing the program, a tough but rewarding and practical learning experience.

                          <p>Jen Burge ’04 is used to the Mark Zuckerberg question. A software engineer at Facebook for the past five years, it seems everyone who hears where she works wants to know if she’s met the 30-year-old billionaire and Facebook founder. “I see him around campus occasionally,” she usually replies, referring to the social media company’s sprawling California headquarters. Being at a high-profile company where the boss is famous might be what intrigues others but for Jen the thrill comes from being able to apply her computer science skills in a way that helps the stars in her own life. “My favorite thing about my job is getting to work on a product my friends and family use every day,” Jen says. “I enjoy knowing that the stuff I do helps so many people stay connected with the people they care about.” <a href="http://www.stonehill.edu/news-media/news/details/stonehill-alumni-are-thriving-on-the-frontier-of-the-internet-economy/">Read More</a></p>
