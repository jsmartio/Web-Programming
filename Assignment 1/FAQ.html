    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <ul>
    <li class="faculty">Is computer science the right major for me?</li>
    <li class="blank">     Computer science courses fall roughly into four (overlapping) categories : theory, architecture, systems software, and applications.<br>     In one particular theory course ( Theory of Computation ) you may discuss the limits of computation ("What problems cannot be solved on a computer?") while in the Algorithms course you may write a program to find the shortest route between, say, New York and Los Angeles and then prove that your solution is correct. In the Compiler Design course you will even learn how to design and implement your own homemade programming language. In the architecture sequence you will explore the computer "under the hood." In Computer Logic and Organization, you will design a small computer on paper and, later, build your computer in the lab where you will see your logic come to life.<br>     Rounding out the curriculum is a number of applications courses like Artificial Intelligence where you will understand how a computer can play chess and even write a few games of your own or Data Structures where you may design a computer simulation to determine how many runways should be built for a community airport. <br>     New to programming, but interested in computer science? Beginners of programming are welcome as all freshmen currently learn the programming language Java in their first year at Stonehill in an entry-level course. In addition to formal courses, most students do internship work in their junior or senior years.<br><br></li>
        
    <li class="faculty">What background do I need to major in computer science?</li>
        <li class="blank">     You need a strong analytical background including mathematics through intermediate algebra and trigonometry, as well as the ability to think logically. <br><br></li>
    
        <li class="faculty">I have had no computer programming in high school, will that be a problem?</li>
        <li class="blank">     No, the introductory programming sequence starts from square one and no particular background is assumed.<br><br></li>
        
        <li class="faculty">What progrmming languages will I learn?</li>
        <li class="blank">     In your freshman year you will study Java. In upper level courses you will learn a variety of other languages such as C++, Scheme, and Perl.<br><br></li>
        
        <li class="faculty">I have heard that computer science is a very difficult and time consuming major. Is that true?</li>
        <li class="blank">     Computer science is definetly a time consuming major, but the rewards for the time and effort are well worth it. <br><br></li>
        
        <li class="faculty">If I major in computer science, is it necessary that I buy a computer before I come to college?</li>
        <li class="blank">     Not at all. You may use any of the lab computer at the college in either the computer lab or the library.<br><br></li>
        
        <li class="faculty">If I major in computer science, can I do an internship in junior or senior year?</li>
        <li class="blank">     Qualified upper classmen often do internships for credit. In fact, in recent years most students have done internship work. Typically, a student will work 10-12 hours per week on his/her internship and earn three semester hours of course credit.  Many of our students do internships at local companies such as General Dynamics, which is an easy  commute to Stonehill.<br><br></li>
        
        <li class="faculty">What are some of the companies where Stonehill alumni work?</li>
        <li class="blank">     Stonehill alumni have done very well on the job market. CS graduates have found jobs at Facebook, Microsoft, General Dynamics, IBM, EMC, RSA, Digital Research Group,  Intersystems, Fidelity, Northrup-Grumman, Abacus Software, Staples, and Putnam Investments to name a few.<br><br></li>

        <li class="faculty">Do may of your graduates attend graduate school?</li>
        <li class="blank">     Many of our students opt to attend graduate school directly after receiving a degree from Stonehill. Some of the schools which our graduates have attended are Brown, Duke, Dartmouth,  University of Virginia,  University of Maryland, Tufts University, University of Massachusetts, Boston University, The University of Texas,  and University of Connecticut<br><br></li>
        
        <li class="faculty">How big are the classes in computer science at Stonehill College?</li>
        <li class="blank">     The introductory classes have about 25 students. The upper level classes may have 10-20 students but may be as small as 4 or 5.<br><br></li>
        
        <li class="faculty">Will I have access to the intern and e-mail at Stonehill College?</li>
        <li class="blank">     All students have accounts with e-mail and wireless access to the Internet. </li>
    </ul>
